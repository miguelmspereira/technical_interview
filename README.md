# Technical Interview Exercise
This exercise uses dataset of lung cancer patients and the aim is to predict patient survival status at the end of 2 years after diagnosis.

The outcome is a binary variable indicating whether a patient has living or deceased status at the end of 2 years.

The dataset contains information about the patients' age, sex, smoking status (current, former, never), cancer stage (Stage I, II, III or IV) and tumor histology (LUAD - lung adenocarcinoma; LUSC - lung squamous cell carcinoma; other).

In addition to the clinical data, there is RNA-seq gene expression data from 4,544 genes. The gene expression data was normalised using standard bioinformatic tools. It does not need to be processed.


**The challenge:

Build a modelling approach to predict 2-year survival in lung cancer.
We are interested in 

This a a stricly technical exercise where the goal is to show code proficiency and domain of data science tools and packages. You are not expected to interpret the results from a clinical perpsective.
While model performance is important, you are not expected to spend time improving models.


**Deliverables:
- Code written to solve the challenge and a report. This can be done in a number of platforms of your choice. The document/s should be uploaded to this repo.
- The report should explain briefly the steps taken to solve the challenge as well as the rationale behind modelling choices.


**Time:
- There is a 24h turnaround time to complete the challenge.
