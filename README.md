# Technical Interview Exercise
This exercise uses dataset of lung cancer patients and the aim is to predict patient survival status at the end of 2 years after diagnosis.

The outcome is a binary variable indicating whether a patient has living or deceased status at the end of 2 years.

The dataset contains information about the patients' age, sex, smoking status (current, former, never), cancer stage (Stage I, II, III or IV) and tumor histology (LUAD - lung adenocarcinoma; LUSC - lung squamous cell carcinoma; other).

In addition to the clinical data, there is RNA-seq gene expression data from ~500 genes. The gene expression data was normalised using standard bioinformatic tools and does not need to be processed.



### The challenge:

Build a modelling approach to predict 2-year survival in lung cancer.
We are interested in building a model to predict survival in lung cancer and to understand how accuratele can we predict it and what are the main predictors of survival.

This is a stricly technical exercise where the goal is to show code proficiency and domain of data science tools and packages. You are not expected to interpret the results from a clinical perpsective.

We would like to see one or two model frameworks applied to this data, the approach used to build a predictive model and how you would assess performance.

While model performance is important, it is not a goal here, so you are not expected to spend time improving models.



### Deliverables:
- The code written to solve the challenge and a report. This can be done in a number of platforms of your choice.
- A report should explain briefly the steps taken to solve the challenge as well as the rationale behind modelling choices.
- You can choose to write the code and the report in the same file (e.g. a Jupyter Notebook or R Markdown file).

The document/s should be uploaded to this repo.


### Timeline:
- There is a 24h turnaround time to complete the challenge.


(all the code provided will be deleted in the future, regardless of the outcome of the interview. No data will be stored.)
